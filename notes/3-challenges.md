CHALLENGES

**Write some sample Lox programs and run them (you can use the implementations of Lox in my repository). Try to come up with edge case behavior I didn’t specify here. Does it do what you expect? Why or why not?
**

I didn't spend ages on this. Generally get clear errors when doing invalid things.

See `./3-a.lox`.

**This informal introduction leaves a lot unspecified. List several open questions you have about the language’s syntax and semantics. What do you think the answers should be?**

recursion?
consts?
can you assign a function to a variable

(yes, no, yes);

---

**Lox is a pretty tiny language. What features do you think it is missing that would make it annoying to use for real programs? (Aside from the standard library, of course.)**

debugger
default values for parameters
anonymous functions
more expressions like ++ -- +=
arrays + related functionality
Async / promises
Streams?
exceptions / try catch throw
richer error handling
regex (standard lib?)
reflection?
