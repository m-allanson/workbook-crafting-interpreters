# Getting started

My notes and answers to the challenges for each chapter are in the `notes` directory.

## Running code

- `brew cask install java`
- `brew cask install intellij-idea-ce`
- `make jlox` to build jlox 
- `./jlox <path to file>`

*Tips*

You can configure IntelliJ to automatically rebuild jlox when any of the source files change. Ensure the file watcher plugin is installed and follow [these steps](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/using-file-watchers.html#ws_creating_file_watchers).
